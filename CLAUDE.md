# autobattler

8-player PvP auto-battler. Server-authoritative with a shared deterministic simulation core used by both server and clients.

## Hard invariants

- `packages/sim` is pure: no I/O, no `Math.random`, no `Date`, no floats
- All arithmetic uses integer fixed-point math (scale 1000 = 1.0)
- All randomness goes through the seeded mulberry32 PRNG in `prng.ts`
- All tuning numbers (unit stats, trait effects, item stats, economy) live in `packages/data`; content lives entirely in data (no content logic in code)
- `packages/balance` is the ONLY package permitted I/O (its CLI writes the report files); `sim`/`rules` stay pure
- Every change must keep determinism tests green (`npm test`)
- Pool conservation: total unit copies across pool + all player benches/boards is constant
- Command legality is enforced server-side in `packages/rules`; invalid commands return typed errors, never throw
- Server result is canon; client sim is presentation only (reconcile with COMBAT_RESULT, log mismatches)
- Combat playback = pure reducer over the event log; the Pixi layer renders reducer output only (never MatchState, never re-runs game logic)
- Bots never persist (no accounts/profiles, accountId null in match_players); all persistence writes go through the `Repository` interface

## Workspace layout

```
packages/
  data/     — JSON content + typed loader, version 0.1.0
  sim/      — pure deterministic combat engine
  rules/    — pure match state machine (no I/O)
  protocol/ — shared WS message types, envelope, encode/decode, validators (zero runtime deps)
  server/   — Node + ws authoritative server (matchmaker, rooms, sessions)
  client/   — Vite + TypeScript + PixiJS v8 web client
  balance/  — headless batch sweeps over the pure sim; CLI writes the report (only I/O-permitted package)
```

## Commands

```bash
npm install          # install all workspace deps (Node >= 20)
npm test             # typecheck (via pretest) + all tests via vitest
npm run typecheck    # tsc --build (must exit 0; npm test runs it automatically via pretest)
npm run dev          # start Vite dev server for the client
npm run server       # start the authoritative WS server (default port 3001)
npm run balance      # run the comp sweep, write balance-report.md + balance-report.json (flags: --seeds N, --out DIR)
docker compose up -d # local postgres:16 (then export DATABASE_URL, see below)
```

Env vars (server): `PORT` (default 3001), `DATABASE_URL` (postgres; unset → in-memory repo), `AUTH_SECRET` (HMAC secret for auth tokens; dev default if unset). With docker compose: `DATABASE_URL=postgres://autobattler:autobattler@localhost:5432/autobattler`. The postgres repo contract tests run only when `DATABASE_URL` is set (skipped + logged otherwise).

## packages/sim internals

- `prng.ts` — mulberry32 seeded PRNG; all sim randomness must use this
- `fixed.ts` — integer fixed-point helpers; scale 1000
- `hex.ts` — axial hex grid 7×8, neighbors, distance, A*
- `types.ts` — UnitDef, TraitDef, ItemDef, UnitInstance (has tier+star), BoardState, CombatEvent, CombatResult
- `engine.ts` — `simulateCombat(boardA, boardB, seed, data) → CombatResult`
  - Applies star multipliers (1.8x at 2-star, 3.24x at 3-star) at combat start
  - Applies trait breakpoint bonuses per team at combat start
  - Applies item stat bundles per unit at combat start
  - Fixed timestep 20 ticks/s, max 1200 ticks then overtime (ramping true damage)
  - Per-tick order: status effects (burn DoT + buff/shield expiry) → mana/cast → movement → attacks → death cleanup
  - Targeting: nearest enemy, tiebreak lowest uid; start-of-combat-stealth units are untargetable until their stealth tick elapses
  - Abilities at full mana (`UnitInstance.ability.effect`): `magic_damage` (single-target), `burn` (magic dmg + DoT), `shield` (self absorb), `buff` (self stat buff, reverted on expiry); `stealth` resolves at combat start, not on cast. Item passives reuse the same primitives: on-hit `burn`, start-of-combat `shield`. Damage routes through any shield before HP.
  - Emits ordered CombatEvent log that fully describes combat without re-running game logic: init (per-unit snapshot post star/item/trait), move (from/to), attack (dmg, crit), cast, mana/hp (absolute values, emitted only on change, hp clamped at 0), death, overtime_start, end (winnerSide, survivingUids)
  - survivingUnits in CombatResult carries tier+star for damage calculation

## packages/data content (v1)

- 50 units across tiers 1-5 (13/13/12/8/4). Each has one `origin` + 1-2 `classes` (flattened into `traits`), role-derived stats, and an `ability {name, manaCost=mana, effect}` from the engine-supported set
- 22 traits: 12 origins + 10 classes, each tagged `kind`; breakpoints at 2/4/6 (or 2/4, or 2) derived so every top breakpoint is reachable by unit count; `knight` keeps its armor curve (+200/+500/+800)
- 45 items: 9 stat-only components (incl. iron_sword/chain_vest/mana_crystal) + 36 completed items, one per distinct unordered component pair (`recipe: [a,b]`); a completed item is a stat bundle + at most one passive (`burn` on-hit or `shield` start-of-combat). Rules equip any item id directly; recipe combination is data-only (see design-notes.md)
- economy.json: pool counts by tier, shop odds by level (tiers 4-5 nonzero from mid levels), xp thresholds, streak table, income constants, damage constants, MMR constants (mmrStart 1000, mmrK 40, mmrEloDivisor 400)
- `ranks.json`: ordered rank bands (Bronze/Silver/Gold/Platinum/Diamond/Master) by ascending `minMmr`; loader exports `RANK_BANDS` + pure `mmrToRank(mmr)` (highest band whose minMmr ≤ mmr, boundaries inclusive on min)
- `design-notes.md`: intent + `// future:` notes for deferred behaviors the engine can't yet execute (kept out of JSON)
- loader exports `DATA_VERSION` (recorded on every persisted match)

## packages/balance internals

- Headless, seeded, pure except the CLI entry (the only I/O-permitted code in the repo)
- `runner.ts` — `runMatchup(boardA, boardB, seeds, data)`: N seeded combats → win rate, avg length, overtime rate, avg survivors
- `compositions.ts` — representative comp archetypes as data (defId+star), `buildBoard` places them deterministically, `activeTraits` lists hit breakpoints
- `sweep.ts` — `runSweep(data, seeds, comps?)`: round-robin every comp vs every other (both orientations) → per-comp win matrix + overall win rate, appearance-weighted per-unit win rate, per-trait win rate, avg game length, overtime rate
- `report.ts` — pure markdown renderer; `cli.ts` (`npm run balance`) runs the sweep and writes `balance-report.md` + `balance-report.json`

## packages/rules internals

- `state.ts` — MatchState, PlayerState, ShopSlot, Phase
- `pool.ts` — pool counts by tier (29/22/18/12/10), draw/return without replacement
- `shop.ts` — roll 5 slots using shopOdds table; reroll returns current shop to pool
- `economy.ts` — calcIncome (base 5 + interest + streak), levelForXp
- `commands.ts` — applyCommand: BUY, SELL, REROLL, BUY_XP, MOVE, EQUIP; validates legality, returns CommandResult (never throws); auto-merge 3 copies → 2-star, cascade 3x 2-star → 3-star
- `rounds.ts` — buildPairings (avoids repeat opponents, ghost on odd count), runCombatPhase, distributeIncome
- `match.ts` — createMatch(seed, data), advancePhase, runMatchToEnd
- `ai.ts` — applyAiCommands(state, playerId, prng, data): seeded bot policy for planning phase

## packages/protocol internals

- Zero runtime deps; pure TypeScript types + helpers
- `messages.ts` — C2SMessage union (QUEUE_JOIN (carries `authToken`), QUEUE_LEAVE, CMD, READY, PING, RECONNECT) and S2CMessage union (QUEUE_STATUS, MATCH_FOUND, STATE_SNAPSHOT, STATE_DELTA, PHASE_CHANGE, COMBAT_START, COMBAT_RESULT, MATCH_END (placements + per-seat `mmr` before/after), ERROR, PONG)
- `envelope.ts` — `{ v, t, p }` envelope; `encode(S2CMessage) → string`; `decodeC2S(raw) → C2SMessage | null` with full runtime validation; `decodeS2C` for client side

## packages/server internals

- Single-process Node server on `PORT` (default 3001): HTTP API + ws on the same port
- `session.ts` — connection registry, seat tokens, per-connection rate limit (20 CMD/s), AFK tracking, accountId set on authed QUEUE_JOIN
- `matchmaker.ts` — FIFO queue; 8 players OR 10s timeout with ≥1 human; backfills remaining seats with AI bots
- `room.ts` — owns MatchState; authoritative 30s planning timer; applies validated commands via applyCommand; broadcasts STATE_DELTA on each accepted command; at combat start runs sim server-side and broadcasts COMBAT_START + COMBAT_RESULT; READY from all human seats skips the 30s wait; at match end persists via recorder before broadcasting MATCH_END (so payload MMR always matches repo state); captures `seatAccounts` at creation
- `index.ts` — HTTP + WS server, heartbeat via ws.ping every 5s, reconnect via token restores seat; QUEUE_JOIN without a valid `authToken` → typed ERROR `UNAUTHENTICATED`
- `auth.ts` — HMAC-signed opaque tokens (`signToken`/`verifyToken`), secret from `AUTH_SECRET` (dev default)
- `http.ts` — minimal HTTP API on the WS port: `POST /auth/guest {deviceId, name?}` → `{accountId, token, profile}` (idempotent per deviceId); `GET /leaderboard?n=50`; `GET /profile` and `GET /history?limit=20` (Bearer token); `PATCH /profile {name}` (Bearer token; `validateName` enforces length 2-16 + charset `[A-Za-z0-9 _-]`, rejects with typed `INVALID_NAME`, persists via `repo.updateProfile`, returns updated profile; bots unaffected); CORS-enabled (GET/POST/PATCH)
- `db/` — `repo.ts` (`Repository` interface: createGuest, findByToken, get/updateProfile, recordMatch, leaderboard, matchHistory), `memory.ts` (default/dev/tests), `postgres.ts` + `schema.sql` (used when `DATABASE_URL` set; migrations = idempotent schema.sql; recordMatch inserts match + match_players and applies profile MMR updates in one transaction); contract test suite runs against both (pg only with DATABASE_URL)
- `mmr.ts` — Elo for 8-player FFA: expected = Elo expectation vs lobby's average MMR excluding self; actual = (8 − placement)/7; delta = round(K·(actual − expected)); K/start/divisor from economy.json; bots count at mmrStart for the lobby average but are never persisted
- `recorder.ts` — `recordMatchResult(repo, matchId, seats)`: fetches profiles, computes deltas, writes match + MMR through the repo, returns per-seat `{before, after}` for the MATCH_END payload

## packages/client internals

- Vite + TypeScript + PixiJS v8; design resolution 390×844, scale-to-fit
- Boot flow: `bootAuth` (guest auth, tolerant of an offline server → null) → Main Menu (not straight to mode select). Practice works offline; Online/Profile/Leaderboard need a reachable server
- `ui/` — DOM/CSS meta-screen layer over the Pixi canvas (`#ui-root` for menus, `#match-overlay` for the in-match pause button/coachmarks; canvas stays Pixi). `app.ts` = `UiApp` screen manager (MainMenu, Play→Practice/Online, Profile, Leaderboard, HowToPlay, Settings) with back-nav, the in-match pause panel (master volume, default speed, Leave Match), and the coachmark trigger. `styles.ts` injects one stylesheet whose colors are CSS custom properties generated from theme.ts; `content.ts` = How-to-Play pages; `coachmarks.ts` = first-match highlight overlay; `dom.ts` = element helpers
- **Theme-as-CSS-vars single source**: `theme.ts` is the only palette. The same numeric colors the Pixi layer uses are exported to the DOM as `:root` custom properties (`applyThemeVars`/`themeCssVars`); DOM/CSS reference them via `cssVar(key)`, never hex literals (theme test forbids `0x` outside theme.ts)
- `settings.ts` — `SettingsStore` persists client prefs in localStorage (master/sfx/music volume, mute, default combat speed 1x/2x, reduced motion). Gameplay-affecting prefs read by the match scene (default speed, reduced motion → CombatView skips non-essential tweens) and audio (volumes/mute). Player name is NOT a setting — changed via `PATCH /profile` (`patchName`)
- `audio/manager.ts` — Web Audio engine; master/sfx/music gain buses bound to Settings volumes, mute zeroes master (pure `computeGain(master, channel, muted)` mirrors the node graph). SFX are synthesized procedurally (oscillators/noise + envelopes): UI (tap/buy/sell/reroll/levelUp/error) + combat (attack/crit/cast/death). Combat audio is a **consumer of the combat fx/effect stream** (`handleCombatFx(frame.fx)` from `combat/player.ts`), never of game logic. Music is a pluggable file slot (`menuTheme`/`matchTheme`) loaded from `assetsBase` (default `/audio`, i.e. `packages/client/public/audio/<slot>.mp3`); no-ops cleanly if the file is absent
- `onboarding.ts` — first-Practice-match coachmark gating (localStorage `ab.coachmarksSeen`, shown once/skippable) + step data; full scripted tutorial match is out of scope (see design-notes.md)
- `auth.ts` — guest auth: deviceId (crypto.randomUUID) + token persisted in localStorage; registers as "Guest" via POST /auth/guest, reuses/validates the stored token via GET /profile; helpers `fetchProfile`/`fetchHistory`/`patchName`/`fetchLeaderboard`; NetDriver sends the token in QUEUE_JOIN
- `mmrToRank(mmr)` (from `@autobattler/data`, thresholds in `ranks.json`) maps MMR → rank band; used by Profile + Leaderboard rows
- Post-match overlay shows placement + MMR delta (from MATCH_END `mmr`) and a Main Menu button; leaving an online match disconnects (driver.dispose → NetClient.stop), forfeiting to last via the server's AFK path (no SURRENDER message exists)
- `driver.ts` — `IDriver` interface + `LocalDriver`: wraps match.ts with 30s planning timer, skippable via ready(); AI commands applied at phase end; emits DriverEvent stream
- `netDriver.ts` — `NetDriver implements IDriver`: drives scene from server messages; runs local sim from received seed for rendering; reconciles with COMBAT_RESULT (logs mismatch)
- `net.ts` — `NetClient`: WS wrapper with reconnect backoff + token; PING/PONG RTT measurement for clock offset
- `scenes/match.ts` — single screen: HP strip, hex board (player 4 rows + opponent 4 rows), bench (9 slots + sell zone), shop bar (5 cards + reroll/buy-xp/ready)
- `combat/` — event-log playback: `reducer.ts` (pure fold of CombatEvents → positions/hp/mana/alive per uid; `stateAtTick`), `player.ts` (tick→ms clock at ticksPerSec, 1x/2x speed, skip-to-end, lerped MOVE spans, typed fx stream; `toDisplayHex` keeps my units on the bottom rows regardless of pairing side, row flip is involutive), `view.ts` (Pixi layer rendering player frames: unit circles + hp/mana bars, attack flash, crit emphasis, cast pulse, damage floaters, death fade, overtime banner)
- **Renderer-is-dumb invariant**: no game logic in the renderer; render strictly from MatchState snapshots and CombatEvent logs; all actions go through driver.playerCommand → applyCommand
- Planning phase: tap shop card to buy; tap unit then tap hex/bench slot to move; tap sell zone to sell; rejections shown as brief toast
- Combat phase: event-log playback of my pairing with speed/skip HUD buttons; LocalDriver holds RESOLUTION until the scene calls `combatPlaybackDone()` (capped at 1x duration + buffer); online, playback auto-skips to the end if the server advances first; PvE/bye rounds show a static board
- Resolution: round result overlay with Continue button; auto-advance after confirm
